    "- Homogeneus in nature\n",
    "- Each selection is done randomly, hence given each seltion equal probability\n",

    "- Make different groups randomly generally homogeneous in respective group.\n",
    "- Then select entire group\n",

    "- Some ordinary scheme is used to select select\n",
    "- Like filtering group with even number in there ids\n",
